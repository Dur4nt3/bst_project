# Binary Search Trees Project

### Binary Search Trees | The Odin Project | JavaScript

This is the ninth project of the "JavaScript" course within "The Odin Project".

The main goal of this project is to practice data structures.

In particular, this project aims to implement a binary search tree data structure in JavaScript.
*Additional functionality was added such that upon creation the BST is balanced, additionally, a `rebalance` method was added to rebalance the tree if it became unbalanced after insertion/deletion.*

`bst.js` includes the class for the data structure, and `main.js` showcases it.

*This project is a CLI-based project (i.e., there is no GUI component), you will need to run this project in the command line via the node CLI utility (installed with NodeJS) using the command `node main.js`.*

*Due to the fact that ES6 modules are used within this project, you might run into issues whilst attempting to run this code. Make sure that you are using node v22 at least (you can check via `node -v`) so node can automatically detect ES6 modules without requiring any further configuration.*

**Skills demonstrated: Binary search trees, data structures, algorithms**
